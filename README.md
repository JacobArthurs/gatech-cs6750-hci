# Georgia Tech University Human-Computer Interaction Course Projects

This repository contains my coursework and projects for **CS 6750: Human-Computer Interaction** as part of the **Georgia Tech Master of Science in Computer Science** program.

## About This Repository

The work demonstrates graduate-level understanding of human-computer interaction principles, including user-centered design, interface design, usability evaluation, prototyping methodologies, and design thinking processes. All interface designs and prototypes were created using Figma to explore and implement HCI concepts.

## Projects

### Individual Project

This project focuses on enhancing Venmo's bill-splitting functionality through iterative design and user feedback. The project integrates three different bill-splitting methods: receipt scanning, manual entry, and even split, into a unified dashboard interface that prioritizes transparency in calculations and user control over the splitting process.

### Group Project

This collaborative project designed an enhanced course catalog interface for Georgia Tech's OMSCS program. The interface features personalized course recommendations, advanced filtering capabilities, historical enrollment data visualization, and an integrated course planner to help students make informed decisions about their academic path.
